                  <p>I'm the most successful person ever to run for the presidency, by far. Nobody's ever been more
                    successful than me. I'm the most successful person ever to run. Ross Perot isn't successful like me.

                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p>Trump's political party affiliation changed numerous times. He registered as a Republican in 1987, a
                  member of the Independence Party, the New York state affiliate of the Reform Party, in 1999,a Democrat
                  in 2001, a Republican in 2009, unaffiliated in 2011, and a Republican in 2012.
                  In 1987, Trump placed full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, advocating peace in Central
                  America, accelerated nuclear disarmament talks with the Soviet Union, and reduction of the federal
                  budget deficit by making American allies pay "their fair share" for military defense. He ruled out
                  running for local office but not for the presidency.</p>
                <h3>Trump as a president</h3>
                <p>The work of the Trump Administration included reforming the U.S. tax code; renegotiating trade
                  agreements with Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and South Korea; expanding the military; defeating the
                  self-proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS); responding to the opioid crisis; improving access to healthcare
                  for veterans; responding to the COVID-19 global pandemic; appointing Federal judges, including the
                  nomination of three U.S. Supreme Court justices; and lowering the cost of prescription drugs.

                  In 2019 President Trump was impeached by the U.S. House of Representatives for abuse of power by
                  soliciting the interference of Ukraine in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and obstruction of
                  Congress by directing defiance of certain subpoenas issued by the House of Representatives. A trial in
                  the U.S. Senate found the President not guilty of the charges brought against him.</p>
